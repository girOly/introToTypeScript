## How does it work?

- Typescript needs to have its syntax transpiled into standard Javascript.
  - Typescript files have the .ts extension, and the transpiler produces the .js extension.


## Types

### Dynamic Types

- Javascript counts with dynamic types, When you declare a variable, you don't define the type:

annexeOne.ex1

- The type will be inferred during execution.

annexeOne.ex2
